Eigen Light-Fields
We propose an appearance-based algorithm for face recognition across pose. Our algorithm can
use any number of gallery images captured at arbitrary poses and any number of probe images
also captured with arbitrary poses. A minimum of one gallery and one probe image are needed,
but if more images are available the performance of our algorithm generally improves.
Our algorithm operates by estimating (a representation of) the light-field of the subjectâ€™s
head. First, generic training data are used to compute an eigenspace of head light-fields,
similar to the construction of eigenfaces. Light-fields are simply used rather than images.
Given a collection of gallery or probe images, the projection into the eigenspace is performed
by setting up a least-squares problem and solving for the projection coefficients similar to approaches
used to deal with occlusions in the eigenspace approach. This simple linear
algorithm can be applied to any number of images captured from any poses. Finally, matching
is performed by comparing the probe and gallery eigen light-fields.
